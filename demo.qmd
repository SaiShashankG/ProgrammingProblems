## A Bit of Math

Markdown supports embedding LaTeX for writing mathematics.

For example, the area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\pi r^2$.

And:

$\Sigma_{x=1}^{n}{x} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

## The Circle

Here is a sample C program using [csketch](https://gitub.com/anandology/csketch) library.

```c
#include <sketch.h>

int main()
{
    // draw a circle with center as (0, 0) and radius 100
    draw_circle(0, 0, 100);

    // save all the shapes draws to lesson2.svg
    save_sketch("circle.svg");
}
```

And that generates a `circle.svg` with the following image.
